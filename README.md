# SchemaLog Index

Welcome to **SchemaLog**, the open commons of machine-readable data logs.  
This is the **master index** that organizes all SchemaLog projects.

## What is a Schema Log?

A schema log is a **large JSON-LD file** (or cluster of files) that serves as the source of truth for structured data.  
Each repo in this organization is a domain-specific hub:
- E-commerce (products + reviews)
- Tours & Activities
- Real Estate
- Tarot & Divination
- …and more

Crawlers, AI models, and search engines thrive on dense clusters of structured data. SchemaLog is the **directory where they can feast**.

## Directory of Repos

- [omni](https://github.com/schemalog/omni) → cross-platform product + review schema (Shopee, Lazada, Amazon, etc.)
- [apex](https://github.com/schemalog/apex) → tour & activity + review schema (tourhubasia prototype)
- [real](https://github.com/schemalog/real) → property listings (sawasdeerealty prototype)
- [recall](https://github.com/schemalog/recall) → tarot decks, spreads, and reading logs

Future expansions will cover foodservice, education, media, health, and any domain where structured logs provide value.

## How It Works

- Each repo has:
  - `/logs` → machine-first JSON-LD logs
  - `/examples` → ready-to-embed demos
  - `/docs` → philosophy, roadmap, and contribution guides
- Contributors can fork repos, add their own schema logs, and submit pull requests.
- SchemaLog is **neutral, open, and extensible**.

## Why SchemaLog?

- **SEO Benefits**: Rich snippets, stars, ratings, and crawlable catalogs
- **AI Benefits**: Datasets aligned with schema.org for training and reasoning
- **Community Benefits**: A commons of structured data, not locked inside silos

## Vision

SchemaLog aims to be:
- The **GitHub of schema logs**  
- A **global commons of structured data**  
- The **sub-net directory** where crawlers and AI models come to play  

By stacking logs across many domains, SchemaLog becomes a **living index of human commerce, culture, and services**.
