# Contributing to SchemaLog

SchemaLog is a commons. Contributions are welcome.

## Steps

1. Choose the repo that fits your domain:
   - `omni` for products + reviews
   - `apex` for tours + activities
   - `real` for property listings
   - `tarot-schema` for tarot + divination
2. Fork the repo.
3. Create a folder inside `/logs` with your brand/project name.
4. Add your schema logs (JSON-LD).
5. Run validation (Rich Results Test, JSON lint).
6. Submit a Pull Request.

## Guidelines

- Keep logs in JSON-LD format.
- Use schema.org vocabulary.
- Include a `version` field.
- Use lowercase + dashes for filenames.
- Include sources if you aggregate reviews.

## Why Contribute?

- Get your data indexed faster.
- Contribute to a shared directory that search engines + AI models already crawl: be in their awareness.
- Strengthen the open-commons movement for structured data.
